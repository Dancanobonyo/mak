<B>1.Networking Problems</B><Br>
A lot of challenges encountered in this court that an IT related to networking as follows:<br>
<ul>
A. Slow Connections<br>
B. Dropped connection<br>
C. Lust or no connection<br>
</ul>
You have to be clear in your mind that the challenge might be caused by the following causes as the<br>
court promises concerned
<ul id="ul1">
A. Local on networking configuration errors<br>
B. Incorrectly configured DNS setting<br>
C. Inefficiently configured routing tables or router faults<br>
D. Inferior ,damage or disconnected cabling<br>
E. Overloaded severs<br>
F. Network conjuction<br>
G. Server/power failures<br>
</ul>
As an IT attachee and any relevant personnel involves ,follow the steps once the networking problems
is encounters<br>
<div class="container">
    <div class="col1>">
<h2>1 . To begin troubleshooting , check the following top issues</h2><br>
 -It's recommended to click the following link for more information<br>
-Trouble shooting the 100/10 PCI ethernet controller<br>
-Setting an onboard ethernet controller to DHCP<br>
-AMD ethernet adapter fails to detect correct duplex mode<br>
<b>Otherwise proceed to step 2</b><br>
<h2>2 Verify the presence of a physical connection by ensuring that link LED illuminates when the
network cable is connected.</h2> <br>Where the network cable plugs into the network card, there are
usually 1 or 2 LED indicators.<br> One should be green (either solid or blinking)<br>
 If the link LED fails to light, it indicates that no physical connection exists to the network.<br>
There may be a problem with either the network cable or the network itself:<br>
<img src="lib/law image.jpeg">
<ul>
• incompatible, or damaged cables
• loose connection, or unplugged cables
• loss of power to a network switch or router
</ul>
✓ Verify that the RJ45 data cable is firmly and properly connected; and is not cut, frayed or
damaged.<br>
✓ Test the connection on a different port of the hub, switch or router. The port may be
defective.<br>
✓ Check the other end of the cable. If it is plugged directly into a hub or switch, you
should also see an LED indicator that there is a connection. <br>If one or both ends
does not have this indicator, try a different cable.<br>
✓ Verify you are using the correct type of cabling for your network application.<br> There are
several types of Ethernet cabling, verify specs and lengths:<br>
✓ Verify that the network adapter is properly seated and is Enabled in BIOS. If the network
interface card (NIC) is a PCI or ISA card, <br>reseat the adapter firmly, making sure that the card is
fully seated in the slot.<br> If using an onboard or built-in NIC, boot into the BIOS program (F1 on
IBM logo screen) and make sure the Ethernet is Enabled.<br> Check your system's Hardware
Maintenance Manual (HMM) for details.<br>
o Verify that the NIC is compatible with the system and other components in the system.
Check the IBM ServerProven Compatibility Website for tested and certified options.<br>
o Make sure all PCI slots are enabled and that the orange power tabs are completely
closed on Hot-swap PCI models.<br> If these tabs are not closed, the slot will receive no
power and will show "Opn HP pow" in the PCI slot information menu of BIOS<br>
        </div>
</div>
<h2>3. Test if you can connect to ANY network host.</h2>
The PING command can be used to check for a basic
network connection to an IP address or hostname.<br>
✓ If you are unable to connect to ANY network hosts, the problem most likely is with the
configuration of your local machine. <br>The local machine may be configured with an incorrect local
IP address, incorrect Netmask settings, or incorrect setup within the operating system.<br>
✓ If you are able to connect to the local network only, the problem is likely due to incorrectly
configured Default Gateway settings.<br>
✓ If you are able to connect to the internal (Intranet) network, but not the outside Internet, the
problem is likely due to DNS or firewall settings.<br>
✓ If you can PING an IP address, but not the corresponding hostname; it indicates a name
resolution or DNS Server configuration problem.<br>
<h2>4. Verify that the network adapter is being seen by the operating system.</h2><br>For Microsoft Windows,
check Device Manager and look for <br>an icon that appears as Network Adapters and see if the network
card is installed:<br>
✓ Right-click the My Computer icon and select Properties.<br>
✓ Click the Hardware tab and press the Device Manager button. The network card should appear
under Network Adapters.<br>
<b>Note: </b>An exclamation mark over a yellow background is an indication that the card is
experiencing a conflict.<br>
<h2>5. Check the operating system for resource conflicts between the NIC and some other system
component.</h2><br> A NIC should not share an IRQ with SCSI or RAID controllers if possible. These settings can
be hard-set within most server BIOS programs.<br>
✓ Press F1 at bootup to enter the Setup/Configuration Utility.<br>
✓ Look under Advanced Setup / PCI Slot/Device Information (or PCI Bus Control) and select the
slot or device to be changed.<br>
✓ Disable any unused devices to free up resources (serial ports, parallel ports, and so forth).<Br>
<h2>6. Check the network settings within the operating system. </h2><br>If the latest driver is loaded in the operating
system and there are no resource conflicts with other devices, check the network settings.<br> Are all
protocols and network hardware setup correctly (cables, hubs, switches, etc.)? <br>Are all IP addresses
unique or is DHCP setup correctly to automatically obtain a TCP/IP address?<Br>
<h2>7. Verify that TCP/IP (or other appropriate protocol) is properly installed. </h2><br>To check this under Microsoft
Windows:<br>
✓ Right-click the My Network Places icon and select Properties. The network card should be
present as Local Area Connection.<br>
✓ Right-click the appropriate Local Area Connection and select Properties. In the Properties
window, make sure that the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is installed.<br>
✓ If TCP/IP is not installed, click Install, click Protocol, and then click TCP/IP.<br>
✓ Once installed make sure that Obtain an IP address automatically, and Obtain DNS server
address automatically are checked (if using DHCP). <br>To verify this, highlight the TCP/IP protocol,
and select Properties. <br>Note: Only use a Static IP Address if your network/Service Provider
requires one.<br>
<h2>8. Verify the TCP/IP address. </h2><br><b>To do this under Microsoft Windows:<br></b>
✓ Click Start, select Programs, select Accessories, and then click Command Prompt.<br>
✓ Type the command, ipconfig. This will list the IP address for the local machine.<br>
✓ If this returns a 169.x.x.x or 0.0.0.0 address, type the following commands, ipconfig /release and
then ipconfig /renew. <br>You should then receive a TCP/IP address appropriate to your network,
along with a Default Gateway address.<br>
✓ Try to communicate with it by typing the command ping x.x.x.x (where x.x.x.x is the IP address
of the Default Gateway).<br>
✓ If this does not give a reply or you did not receive a TCP/IP address, go to the next step.<br>
<h2>9. Ping the loopback address. </h2><br>To do this under Microsoft Windows:<br>
✓ Click Start, select Programs, select Accessories, and then click Command Prompt.<br>
✓ Type the command, ping 127.0.0.1. This will send a message to the internal network stack on
the machine. You should see a response like this:<br>
Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:<br>
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128<br>
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128<br>
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128<br>
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128<br>
Ping statistics for 127.0.0.1:<br>
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>
Approximate round trip times in milliseconds:<br>
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms<br>
<h2>10. Check if you can PING the system's IP address.</h2><br>To troubleshoot the IBM hardware, connect the
system directly to another system or a client using a crossover cable or dumb-hub.<br> Setup TCP/IP using
two consecutive addresses (e.g. 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2) and use the default <br>subnet masks (255.0.0.0).
From a command prompt, try to PING the client IP address. <br>If the system gets a response, the IBM
hardware is fine. <br>If unable to PING using the above setup, and you are using ethernet, <br>are all cables CAT5 and hubs 10/100? If not, swap the cable and/or hub.<br> Make sure to use a straight-through cable with a
hub and a crossover cable if going directly from server to client.<br> If using a known good crossover cable or
hub, try uninstalling and reinstalling the network driver and protocols.<br> Contact your network
administrator for more help.<br>
<h2>11. Verify the most recent driver for the adapter is installed.</h2> <br>If the NIC is showing up in the system BIOS
or during POST,<br> but it's not recognized by the operating system, make sure the latest driver is loaded.<br>
Some native operating system drivers have known performance issues with IBM NICs. <br>Please check
the IBM Systems Support Website for the latest device drivers for IBM servers, IntelliStation
workstations, and network interface card options.<br>
<b>Note: </b><br>If you are using a card from a different manufacturer, please check the card's documentation for
the proper Website to visit<br>
<b>Incase all didn’t work then do step 12.</br></b>
